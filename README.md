# Global warming
Could there be a relationship between the rising of the global temperatures and the number of natural disasters?

This question came up when talking to a friend about the unbelievable situation going on in Australia right now, where the whole country is engulfed in [fire](https://myfirewatch.landgate.wa.gov.au). We were wondering if the rising of the global temperatures could have a significant impact in the frequency and also in the destruction level of the natural disasters. My answer would be yes because I've [read](https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/how-can-climate-change-affect-natural-disasters-1?qt-news_science_products=0#qt-news_science_products) in a few places that the increase in the global surface temperatures would likely to cause more droughts and the raise in the water vapor in the atmosphere could fuel ever more powerful storms

But I wasn't sure and I had no data to backup my assumptions. I then dig up some information about the [global surface temperatures](https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data) for the last decades and the occurrences, as well as the type of the [natural disasters](https://www.kaggle.com/dataenergy/natural-disaster-data) for the same period. This simple analysis shows my findings.
